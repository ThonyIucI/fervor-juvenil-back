# 1
Create a linear ticket for a user story defined in the requeriment.md file.

# 2
Create a new branch that syncs with linear and start working on the user story. Impllmenet first FER-X tests. Leave them empty we will impmlement them later. I want to follow the TDD approach.

# 3
Implement the required logic (with an in memory database) to pass the created tests. Ensure that the tests are passing.
